#summary Perform clustering autonomously without GUI interaction. Useful for scripting.

=General Options=

        -f <filename>                   Load <filename> for clustering.  Default Parser: Normal
        -p <parser>                     Parse <filename> with <parser>.  Only valid with the -f option.  E.g. 'Normal'
        -d                              Don't init display, run from console. This happens automatically if there is no
                                        display or the required libraries are unavailable.

=Data Normalisation=

        --log2, --nolog2                Perform log2 reexpression, or turn it off. Default is off.
        --submedians, --nosubmedians    Perform median centring, or turn it off. Default is off.
                                        NOTE: Turning this on will turn off mean centring.
        --center, --nocenter            Perform mean centring, or turn it off. Default is on.
                                        NOTE: Turning this on will turn off median centring.
        --scale, --noscale              Perform RMS scaling, or turn it off. Default is off.
        --normvar, --nonormvar          Normalise variance to 1 for each subsample, or turn it off. Default is off.

=PCA and Feature Selection=

        --nopca                         Do not perform PCA at all. This precludes feature selection.
                                        Useful if your data is known to be singular.
        --pcafraction <fraction>        Select features from the top <fraction> principle components. Default is 0.85
        --eigweight <fraction>          Select the top <fraction> features by weight in each principle component.
                                        Default is 0.25
        --noselection                   Do not perform feature selection. Simply sets pcafraction and eigweight to 1.

=Sample Selection=

        -c <file1 file2 file3 ..>       Define samples (one on each line) in file1, etc as clusters.  Sample set will be
                                        reduced to these samples, and their labels will be shown in logs and PCA plot.
        --krange <fst> <snd>            Repeat for each kvalue between <fst> and <snd> inclusive. Default is 2 to 6.
        --subsamples  <fraction>        Number of clustering iterations to perform. Default is 300.
        --subfraction <fraction>        Select a random <fraction> of the samples each iteration. Default is 0.80
        -h, --help                      Print help and exit.

=Example=

        python common.py -f mydata.txt -d --log2 --submedians --noselection -c clusterdefs/*

        Opens mydata.txt, log2 reexpresses and median centres the data, performs no feature selection, and begin clustering using the cluster definitions in the clusterdefs folder without using the GUI.
